# Module 4: Backups and Malware

## Overview 
This module covers how and why to back up your data, and how to protect your system from malware and scams.

Youâ€™ll learn:
- Why backups matter at home and work  
- How to set up and schedule effective backups  
- Pros and cons of common backup tools  
- Basics of malware, phishing, and spam  
- How to scan and protect your system  

### Key Terms

- **Backup**: A saved copy of system or personal data that can restore your computer to a previous state.
- **Spam**: Unwanted, often automated messages sent to many users.
- **Phishing**: Fake messages designed to trick you into giving up personal information.
- **Virus**: A harmful program that can replicate and spread between files.
- **Worm**: A virus that spreads across networks.
- **Trojan**: Malware that hides inside other software and performs harmful actions in secret.
- **Malware**: A general term for any malicious software, including viruses, worms, and Trojans.

## Backups

Backups are essential for protecting data from accidental changes, system failures, file corruption, or ransomware attacks.

### Why Backups Matter
- Undo unwanted changes
- Recover from hardware failure or data loss
- Restore corrupted or deleted system files
- Defend against ransomware

### Two Key Factors for Reliable Backups
- **Frequency**: More frequent backups reduce potential data loss.
- **Reliability**: Backups should not share the same vulnerabilities as the system. Offsite backups improve resilience.

### Best Practices
- Keep multiple dated copies.
- Store backups securely and separately.
- Ensure backups are easy to restore and cost-effective.
- Use a rotation schedule to manage backup storage.

### Planning Your Backup
1. **Identify** critical data.
2. **Choose a storage location**:  
   - Local (fast & cheap, but less reliable)  
   - Offsite (secure, but slower and costlier)
3. **Set frequency** based on risk and importance.
4. **Select a backup type**:  
   - Full  
   - Incremental  
   - Differential
5. **Decide on compression/encryption** as needed.
6. **Test recovery** regularly.
7. **Automate** to reduce human error.

## Methods of Backups

### Three Main Backup Types

- **Full Backup**  
  Backs up all data every time.  
  *Advantages:* Easy and fast recovery, all files in one set.  
  *Disadvantages:* Takes longer and uses more storage.

- **Incremental Backup**  
  Backs up only changes since the last backup (full or incremental).  
  *Advantages:* Faster and uses less storage.  
  *Disadvantages:* Slower, more complex restores.

- **Differential Backup**  
  Backs up changes since the last full backup.  
  *Advantages:* Faster restores than incremental, more efficient than full.  
  *Disadvantages:* Uses more storage than incremental, slower than full backup.

### Other Backup Schemes

- **Automatic Backup**  
  Runs backups automatically at set times (e.g., Windows Backup).

- **Snapshot-style Backup**  
  Manual copy before changes; stable versions replace previous backups.

- **Adhoc Backup**  
  Stores data offsite, tracks incremental changes, ideal for large datasets.

- **Mirror Backup**  
  Creates an exact copy of source data; deletions on source reflect in backup.  
  *Not ideal* as it can delete important backup files.

- **Full Computer Backup**  
  Creates a complete image of the entire PC.  
  *Advantages:* Easy full restore, good for crashed OS.  
  *Disadvantages:* Hardware changes may break restore; copies viruses/corrupt files.

### Storage Locations

- **Local Backup**  
  Stored on same device or local drive.  
  *Advantages:* Fast and cost-effective.  
  *Disadvantages:* Vulnerable to hardware failure and malware.

- **Offsite Backup**  
  Stored separately from source, e.g., external drives or cloud.  
  *Advantages:* Protection from local hardware failures.  
  *Disadvantages:* More expensive, recovery can be slower.

- **Online Backup**  
  Stored remotely via network or internet (cloud services).  
  *Advantages:* Good protection against hardware failure and easier than traditional offsite backups.  
  *Disadvantages:* Higher cost, slower initial backup and recovery.


## Malware

Malware is any unwanted software that can harm a computer.

### Examples:
- **Viruses**
- **Trojans**
- **Worms**
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails that mimic legitimate companies to steal sensitive data (e.g., fake login pages).

### Common Scams:
- Lottery win scams
- Account lock frauds
- Nigerian Widow scam
