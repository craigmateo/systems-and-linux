# Module 12: Electronic Waste, Linux Partitioning, and Computer Market

This module covers three key topics:

- **Electronic Waste (E-Waste):**  
  Introduces e-waste, its environmental impact, and the financial benefits of proper management.

- **Linux Disk Partitioning:**  
  Explains disk partitioning concepts and tools with a step-by-step video demonstration.

- **Buying a Computer:**  
  Highlights important specifications and considerations to avoid under- or over-purchasing.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept and management of electronic waste  
- Perform Linux disk partitioning  
- Understand key specifications when buying a computer  

### Key Terms

- **Electronic Waste:**  
  Electrical or electronic devices discarded or destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal.

## Electronic Waste (E-Waste)

- E-waste includes discarded electrical and electronic devices, growing rapidly due to increased machine dependence.
- Contains hazardous materials that can harm the environment if improperly handled.
- Also contains valuable materials like gold and rare earth metals, making recycling ("urban mining") important.
- UN estimates more gold can be recovered from e-waste than from earth.
- Proper management prevents environmental damage and recovers scarce materials.
- Ontario, Canada’s WEEE program (since 2009) manages e-waste disposal through five levels:
  - **Stewards:** Brands/importers responsible for reporting and fees.
  - **Remitters:** Pay fees on behalf of Stewards.
  - **Service Providers:** Handle collection, processing, and reuse.
  - **Retailers:** Sell electronics and may manage collections.
  - **Customers:** Pay recycling fees when buying electronics.
- Personal data must be removed before disposal to protect privacy.

## Linux Disk Partitioning

Linux offers several tools for disk partitioning and management, available both via command line and graphical interfaces:

- **Fdisk**  
- **GNU Parted**  
- **Gparted**  
- **GNOME Disks** (GNOME Disks Utility)  
- **KDE Partition Manager**  
- **Qtparted**  

## Computer Market

Before buying a computer, it’s important to understand the market and key specifications:

- **RAM**  
  Active memory used by applications. Minimum for Windows 10 (64-bit) is 2 GB, but 8 GB is recommended for smooth performance.

- **Processor**  
  The CPU affects performance and budget. Intel’s series range from i3 (entry-level) to i9 (high-end). Consider the processor generation for better performance.

- **Storage Device**  
  Options include traditional HDDs and faster, lighter SSDs. Hybrid setups use SSD for OS and HDD for data to balance cost and speed.

- **Screen Size and Resolution**  
  Larger screens are heavier. Resolution matters for tasks like gaming (4K available but costly). For general use, standard resolution helps save cost.
