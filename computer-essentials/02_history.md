# Module 2: History of Computers & Computer Parts

## Overview
This module covers the history and evolution of computers, from early electromechanical devices to modern powerful and compact machines. It introduces essential computer components along with detailed explanations of their specifications, helping you understand what to consider when purchasing a computer.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Describe the history and evolution of computers.
- Identify and explain the basic components of modern computers.
- Understand key factors to consider when buying a computer.

## Key Terms and Concepts

### Computer
An advanced digital device that reads information, executes instructions, processes data, and generates output.

## History of Computers

Computers have evolved through many phases, starting from early tools like the Abacus and programmable analog devices by Ismail al-Jazari, to Charles Babbage’s 19th-century analytical engine. Modern electronic computers began in the 20th century and have progressed through five generations:

- **First Generation (1940–1956):** Used vacuum tubes, large and power-hungry machines like ENIAC and UNIVAC; no operating systems, performed one task at a time.
- **Second Generation (1956–1963):** Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, cheaper, and more reliable; introduction of memory and operating systems.
- **Third Generation (1964–1971):** Integrated circuits (ICs) replaced transistors, improving speed and reducing size and power consumption; multitasking introduced.
- **Fourth Generation (1971–present):** Microprocessors enabled computers to shrink dramatically; rise of personal computers (IBM, Apple), MS-DOS, and Windows operating systems.
- **Fifth Generation (present and beyond):** Early development of AI-based intelligent computers marks this generation’s beginning.

Computers have become integral to daily life, with ongoing rapid advancements in speed and computing power.

## Computer Parts
Like organs in the human body, a computer’s hardware parts each serve specific, essential roles that enable the system to function. Understanding these components and their specifications helps in evaluating or purchasing a computer that fits your needs.

- **Motherboard:** The main circuit board that connects all hardware components. Compatibility with other parts (CPU, RAM, etc.) is critical.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Known as the "brain" of the computer, it processes data and instructions. Key specs include cores, clock speed (GHz), cache, and integrated graphics.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Fast, temporary memory used to store active data for quick CPU access. The speed and size of RAM directly affect performance.
- **Hard Drive (Secondary Storage):** Permanent storage for all files and applications. Comes in various capacities (GB–TB) and types, with transfer speed as a key spec.
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):** Distributes stable power to all components and protects against voltage irregularities.
- **Input Devices:** Devices like a keyboard, mouse, or scanner that send data to the computer.
- **Output Devices:** Devices like monitors and printers that present processed data to the user.
