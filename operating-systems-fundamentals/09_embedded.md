# Module 9: OS on Embedded and Low-Power Devices

## Overview

This module demonstrates the ability of Linux to run on low-powered devices such as the Raspberry Pi and a wide array of IoT devices. We will wrap up the course with a course review that will help us prepare for the final exam.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain Linux’s role in embedded electronic devices and the Internet of Things (IoT)
- Explain how Linux can be used to extend the lifespan of older computer hardware
- Implement Linux installation in order to minimize power consumption
- Explain the explosive growth of the Raspberry Pi foundation and its community

### Key Terms and Concepts

Below are a list of terms and concepts that you will come across throughout this module:

#### Embedded systems

An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.[1][2] It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within.

#### IoT (Internet of Things)

The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

#### Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

## Bringing Life to Older Hardware

Please read the following article on bringing new life to old hardware. Linux on older hardware can be used to run modern media centers, media streaming servers (DLNA), file/ftp servers, and game server hosts such as Minecraft servers, etc.

**Excerpt:**

One of the many great aspects of the Linux operating system is its ability to bring new life to old hardware. This is not only a boon for your bottom line but also an environmentally sound philosophy. Instead of sending that older (still functioning) hardware to the trash heap, give it a second lease on life with the help of Linux. You certainly won’t be doing that with Windows 7, 8, or 10. Linux, on the other hand, offers a good number of options for those wanting to extend the life of their aging machines.

## Low-Power Options

The following guide can help to keep your operating system using low-powered options to keep operating costs low:

**Excerpt:**

Reducing system power consumption will extend battery life, reduce system temperature and (on some models) reduce system fan noise. Power consumption can be greatly improved from a stock distribution configuration to a fine-tuned system.

## Embedded Devices

Linux is undisputedly the leading operating system for embedded devices.

Linux can be found in automobile dashboards, television set top boxes, gaming systems, industrial appliances, aircraft, etc.

Linux skills are in high demand and growing.

Here are some tips on how to accelerate embedded Linux development:

## RaspberryPi

The RaspberryPi foundation has designed and built powerful and fully functional computers for as low as $35 USD!

With over 30 million units sold, the success is undeniable.

The RaspberryPi 4 boasts the following specs:

- Dual display – 4k output  
- Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz  
- 1GB, 2GB or 4GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM (depending on model)  
- 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE  
- Gigabit Ethernet  
- 2 USB 3.0 ports; 2 USB 2.0 ports  
- Raspberry Pi standard 40 pin GPIO header (fully backwards compatible with previous boards)  
- 2 × micro-HDMI ports (up to 4kp60 supported)  
- 4-pole stereo audio and composite video port  
- H.265 (4kp60 decode), H264 (1080p60 decode, 1080p30 encode)  
- OpenGL ES 3.0 graphics  
- Micro-SD card slot for loading operating system and data storage  
- Power over Ethernet (PoE) enabled (requires separate PoE HAT)  
- Operating temperature: 0 – 50 degrees C ambient  
- *A good quality 2.5A power supply can be used if downstream USB peripherals consume less than 500mA in total.*
