## Key Terms and Concepts

### File
A file is a common unit in a computer that stores data, information, settings, or commands used with a computer program.

### Folders
Folders hold one or more files, and they are also called directories because of the way they organize data within the file system of a storage device. All folders are subfolders or subdirectories of the root directory.

### Windows Environment
> “The Windows environment is the onscreen work area provided by Windows, analogous to a physical desktop, and the operating system's core extension points.” [2]

## Files and Folders

Windows organizes data using files and folders, managed through File Explorer—a graphical tool for navigating, organizing, and maintaining your system’s storage.

File Explorer lets you:
- Access recent items via Quick Access
- Perform tasks like move, copy, delete, and rename
- Use features like the Ribbon Toolbar, Navigation Bar, and Search

You can drag-and-drop to move or copy items, or use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands.

## Windows Environment

The Windows environment is your main work area and control hub. Key parts include:

- **Desktop**: Main workspace
- **Taskbar**: Access programs, commands, and notifications
- **Notification Area**: Shows program statuses
- **Control Panel**: Adjust system settings
- **Help**: Find guidance for tasks
- **User Account Control**: Manage user permissions

## Environment Variables

Environment variables store values used by the OS and software (e.g., `%TEMP%`, `%WINDIR%`).

- **User variables**: Specific to the logged-in user
- **System variables**: Apply system-wide

**To edit Path in Windows 10**:
1. Search: “Edit the system environment variables”
2. Click **Environment Variables**
3. Select **Path** (under System), then click **Edit** to add or change entries (separate paths with semicolons)
